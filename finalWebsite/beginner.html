	<h3>Get to know your machine</h3>
		<p>Modern metal detectors come with a wide variety of settings and features.  From detection modes, discrimination, sensitivities, ground balancing, and even coil size, it can be quite daunting at first.  Always start with reading your user manual, and YouTube is an excellent resource for tutorials in almost every make and model available. Beyond that, practice makes perfect. Try planting some coins in your yard or a sandbox to get a feel for how your device reacts to different metals, distances, and substrates.</p>

	<h3>Where to dig</h3>
		<p>The best place to start detecting is often your own backyard.  Typically, you won’t find much apart from spare change and old nails, but practice is necessary to better learn your machine and perfect your digging technique. If you do not have a backyard, try asking a friend or neighbor for permission to use theirs. Another great place is a local park, hot spots tend to be next to benches, swings, and sidewalks.</p>

	<h3>Important Notes Before Digging</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Check your local laws before digging, as many national parks have prohibitions or restrictions on detecting.</li>
		<li>Ask for permission before digging, never trespass on someone’s property or dig without permission.</li>
		<li>Be aware of your surroundings, especially if you are near a road or possible underground utilities.</li>
		<li>Leave minimal impact from your dig, always fill in your holes and resettle the grass.</li>
		</ul>
