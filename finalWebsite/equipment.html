	<h3>Detectors</h3>
		<p>The primary tool you will need is a metal detector.  Detectors can vary in size, complexity, and of course price. When you are first starting out, it is best to get a cheaper model with fewer options to build some experience before investing in a higher tier model.  A second, smaller detector called a pin-pointer is often used to scan the sides of your hole to help locate difficult targets.</p>

<section>
	<h3>Digging Tools & Sifters</h3>
		<p>You’ve located your target, but how do you get it out? By digging of course! While a few targets can be found on top of the soil, most are located three to six inches underground.  A small, sharp hand trowel can cut a circle of grass, or plug, to reveal the softer soil. Some detectorists prefer using a large knife to cut through the edges of thick mats of grass. If your substrate is sand, a small pan sifter can filter out potential targets as well.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Carrying Pouches</h3>
		<p>After putting in the effort to find your target, the last place you want to put it is in your pocket, where it is likely to fall out again.  Instead bring a backpack, old tool pouch, or the ever-fashionable fanny pack, with smaller Ziploc bags for particularly valuable treasures.</p>

	<h3>Our Gear</h3>
		<p>While we have put a lot of money into this, you certainly to not have to in order to have fun.  E prefers knives for digging, C uses a hand trowel. Other supplies include; gloves, sunhats, bug spray, and non-metallic shoes.</p>
