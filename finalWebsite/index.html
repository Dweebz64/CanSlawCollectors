	<h2>What is "Canslaw"?</h2>
		<p>Canslaw is detectorist jargon for the shredded remains of aluminum cans. It is often found in small ribbons reminiscent of coleslaw, and unfortunately a very common find.  Since aluminum rings the same tones as gold, we always dig it just in case.  This has led to us discovering quite a bit of it, hence Canslaw Collectors.</p>

	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		<p>We are a nerdy, husband and wife duo in the Midwest, looking for an excuse to go on hikes and play in the dirt. E is an outdoorsman and coin-collector, and C is a hippie and history enthusiast.</p>

<section>
	<h2>Why metal detecting?</h2>
		<p>While E is picking back up a childhood hobby, which he insists isn’t part of a mid-life crisis, C sees it as an opportunity for modern day treasure hunting.  Even if we don’t find anything old or valuable, we’re still spending time together out in nature.</p>
